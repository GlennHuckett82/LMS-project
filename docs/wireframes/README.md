# Wireframe PNGs

Export the six key wireframes from Figma as PNG files and place them in this folder. Use clear, consistent filenames, for example:

- Scope home.png
- Scope login.png
- Scope register.png
- Scope dashboard.png
- Scope lessons.png
- Scope quizzes.png

These images should match the frames in your Figma prototype (Home → Login → Register → Dashboard → Lesson → Quiz & Result).

Optional, but recommended for documentation:

- Export your user flow / wireframe flow chart as a single PNG (for example: `lms project flow chart.png`) and save it in this folder alongside the screen PNGs.
